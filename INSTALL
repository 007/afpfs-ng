This is a quick guide on how to get started quickly.

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE TO SHARE OR MOVE ANY CRITICAL DATA.  
You've been warned.

To get running:

1. Requirements

This is known to work on Fedora Core 5, but should work on other Linux 
distributions.  It will require the FUSE package and is known to work
with 2.5.3 but no other version has been tested.

2. Compile afpfs-ng

tar -xzf afpfs-ng-0.2.tar.bz2
cd afpfs-ng-0.2
./configure
make install

3. Run afpfsd

As the user who will be needing to access, the file, run the management daemon
by running:

afpfsd

This should fork off.  You should see messages in /var/log/messages.  For more
details, run it with the '-d' option to see detailed debug info.

You should be able to leave it running.

4. Mount

Run:

afp_client mount -u <username> -p <pass> <server>:<volume> <mountpoint>

After this, you should be able to access files on <mountpoint>.

5. Status

You can see status of the connection by running 'afp_client status'

You should also see a reasonable entry with 'mount'

6. Unmount

You can unmount your mount using 

   fusermount -u <mountpoint>
or 
   afp_client unmount <mountpoint>
