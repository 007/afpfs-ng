This quick document describes how to gather debugging information for afpfs-ng.

Thank you for contributing to the project by submitting a bug report!  This
software's quality is heavily influenced by reported bugs.  We will help 
you as best we can.

Before we start:
- be aware of sending confidential information over the wire and saving it in 
  your logs
- more information may be required, but this is a good start


1. Kill off any lingering versions of afpfsd

By default, afp_client kicks off a copy of afpfsd in the background.  Kill it
with:

       killall -9 afpfs-ng

2. Rerun afpfsd in debug mode

Run:

       afpfsd -d > my_debug_log

This will record lots of logging output to a file.  Keep this running in a 
window.


3. Grab the status output

Get the status with:

       afp_client status > my_status

This will exit quickly.


4. Start a network dump

You can run the following on Mac OS X, Linux or other systems.  You can do this
on either the client, server, or a system that sits in between the client and
server.  You'll need root access.

Run:

       tcpdump -s0 -w my_network_capture port 548

There are other tools to do this, like wireshare/ethereal.  Use those if it is
easier, but save it in a tcpdump format.

Keep this running in a window until after you've shown the bug.

5. Setup the mount

How you setup the mount is dependent on your environment.  Run your 
'afp_client mount ...' command and copy it into a file called my_command.txt

6. Rerun whatever causes the problem

7. Send off a bug report

Kill the tcpdump and afpfsd processes.

Tar up all the relevant files with something like:

	tar -czf my_afpfsd_bug.tar.gz \
		my_network_capture my_debug_log my_status my_command.txt

Write an email message with a description of the problem.  There are two 
places to email this:
a) afpfs-ng-devel@windriver.com (preferred)
b) alexthepuffin@gmail.com
