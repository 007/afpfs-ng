To do before 0.5:
fuse:
- when unmounting the second of three, three is horked

other:
- full code review
- restrictions document
- bugs document
- update online docs
- packaging for rpm, debian
* chgrp doesn't work if you don't have a common user directory

AFP 2.x
- make everything executable
- du -s only reports zero; check links?

Test against airport, mac os:
- test group and unix perms on an airport
- read
- mv


Won't fix:

- On occasion, when doing a mount with the fuse client, there can be a 
  delay of 10 seconds.

- there are some locking problems with FUSE which can cause a halted
  filesystem under heavy traffic loads

- on Mac OS X, gcrypt 1.4.0 or later is required.  1.2.4 has a dynamic linker
  bug which will break afpfs-ng whenver gcrypt functions are called.

- on file get and put, we don't really pay attention to tx and rx quantums.
  This can make for inefficient transfers.

- FreeBSD has quite a few problems with it; the port is simply incomplete.
  Among the problems:
  - the fuse implementation is totaly untested
  - there can be some long delays when initiating connections

- on some clients, such as afpgetstatus, ^C won't work
