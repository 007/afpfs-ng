To do before 0.5:
cmdline:
- operations on files with a space
- prompt for password
- error when figuring out where to put transferred file
- Forced exit when putting full URL on path
- local path after disconnect
- problem with changing directory

fuse:
- creating and copying a new file has problems
- shutting down notice works, but doesn't unmount
- use mount_afp syntax
- volinfo
- verify that disconnnect works properly 
- multiple server mounts are broken
- default logging is stdout
- nonempty mount point

Mounting alexdevries on /tmp/xa20
Actually mounting.
Unmounting volume alexdevries from /tmp/xa20
Mounting succeeded.

- startup can be really slow



General errors:
- check unix permission checking
- make sure dsi messages aren't too big
- When passing a sockaddr_un struct, you need to account for the extra
    byte on the end of the path string where the trailing NULL goes. :)
- locking arrangements
- measure, compare performance for put, get
- streamline airport, netatalk detection
- mimick locking on 10.5.  Use mult-user in file attributes of
  getfiledirparms?
- interrupt activity with disconnect

other:
- manpages
- full code review
- update online docs
- packaging for rpm, debian
- buildable on BSD
- buildable without crypto
- buildable without fuse
- buildable without readline
- buildable on Mac OS 10.5
- get rid of required frees (readdir)
- check syslog output
- in call around ml_readdir, do we convert names?
- rename client_setup
- volumes' HasConfigInfo
- hard links for files?
- use soft create for FPCreateFile
- I'm sure file name length is handled incorrectly for UTF8
- requested version needs to be redone
- is isdir backwards?
- use fploginext instead of fplogin, check Mac OS client
* chgrp doesn't work if you don't have a common user directory
* non-utf8 server names
- read only
