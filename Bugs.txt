To do before 0.5:
cmdline:
- operations on files with a space
- volume password
- "//.volinfo is not a directory, mode is 00"


fuse:
- check that port works
- volinfo
- group problem: uid/gid mapping: Login ids (501/0)

General errors:
- test under heavy traffic
- When passing a sockaddr_un struct, you need to account for the extra
    byte on the end of the path string where the trailing NULL goes. :)
- locking arrangements
- mimick locking on 10.5.  Use mult-user in file attributes of
  getfiledirparms?

other:
- 'ls .afpvolinfox' gives IO error
- URL checking syntax
- get_dirid is supposed to be const char *, same with is_dir
- get rid of bcopy
- measure, compare performance for put, get
- I have no idea what this is a reply to, when cmdline with file of 2048
- manpage, afp_mount, afpfsd, afp_client
- full code review
- restrictions document
- bugs document
- update online docs
- packaging for rpm, debian
- buildable on BSD
- buildable without crypto
- buildable without fuse
- buildable without readline
- buildable on Mac OS 10.5
- get rid of required frees (readdir)
- check syslog output
- in call around ml_readdir, do we convert names?
* chgrp doesn't work if you don't have a common user directory
- airport unix perms
