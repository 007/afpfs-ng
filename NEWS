What is new in afpfs-0.4, Feburary 11, 2007
-------------------------------------------

We're happy to release version 0.4 of afpfs-ng, the Apple Filing Protocol client
for Linux with FUSE.

New features include:

- stability: afpfs-ng is reliable to the point of being usable for all but
  the most strenuous IO loads

- encrypted authentication mechanisms: now also supporting Randnum, 2-way
  randnum, DHCAST128 and DHX2

- performance: DID caching, enhanced DSI packet processing and other
  improvements make afpfs-ng about half as fast as the Mac OS X client

- ease of use: unmounting, SIGINT, easier logging, easier startup, better
  docs, session suspension

What is new in 0.3, Nov. 27, 2006
---------------------------------
* many, many memory leaks fixed with some help from valgrind and close inspection
* fixed many segfaults from null pointer dereferencing
* heap corruption fixed
* server version matching works now (afpfs-ng speaks 3.2 by default)
* more testing against 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and netatalk
* some documentation
* preliminary support for resource forks (although this is still incomplete and broken) 

0.2 had a lot of problems with stability, mostly because of the complex and optimized DSI read code, which does zero-copy reads and handles quantums properly. This appears to be fixed now.

Please, if you've tried afpfs-ng, let me know.  You can subscribe to the mailing list at http://sourceforge.net/projects/afpfs-ng, or mail me at alexthepuffin@gmail.com.


What is new in 0.2, Nov. 20, 2006
---------------------------------

In version 0.2, the project has matured considerably.  You can mount a volume,
see, read and write files with reasonable performance.

* much better testing against 10.3 and 10.4 (speaking AFP 3.1, not 3.2)
* better error handling
* restructured into client/server
* rewrote incoming reads to optimize for read performance.  It works!
* lots and lots of other changes
  - fixed rename, large dids, UTF8 names
* dynamic quantum calculation
* status
* new logging mechanism, forking
* autoconf (sigh)


What is new in 0.1, Oct. 16, 2006
---------------------------------
* it compiles
* it has worked for me, but probably nobody else
